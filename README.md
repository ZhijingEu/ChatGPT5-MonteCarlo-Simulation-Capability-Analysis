### 2. Schedule Risk Analysis - "Garden Landscaping Project"  
- **Scenario**: Project schedule with uncertain activity durations
- **Complexity**: High (calendar logic + critical path + sensitivity analysis)
- **ChatGPT-5 Performance**: ‚ùå **Poor**
- **Key Issues Identified**:
  - Off-by-one date calculation errors
  - Incorrect handling of non-working days
  - Schedule Sensitivity Indices calculated as zero
  - Unreliable critical path identification

## üìà Results Summary

| Analysis Type | ChatGPT-5 Grade | Key Strengths | Major Limitations |
|---------------|----------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Cost Risk** | A- | Methodology selection, correlation handling, statistical accuracy | Minor: Limited advanced distribution options |
| **Schedule Risk** | D+ | Conceptual understanding, code structure | Critical: Date arithmetic, calendar logic, sensitivity calculations |

## üö® Key Findings & Implications

### ‚úÖ What Works Well
- **Simple to moderate complexity** cost risk analyses
- **Intelligent methodology selection** without explicit guidance
- **Code generation** using appropriate libraries (Python + scipy/numpy)
- **Statistical accuracy** for standard Monte Carlo applications

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Significant Limitations  
- **Complex scheduling logic** (calendars, constraints, dependencies)
- **Specialized sensitivity calculations** for schedule analysis
- **Resource-constrained scenarios** and advanced project scheduling features
- **Data security concerns** when using web-based LLMs for sensitive project data

### üéØ Practical Recommendations
- **Use for**: Proof-of-concept analyses, educational purposes, simple cost modeling
- **Avoid for**: Production schedule risk analysis, sensitive commercial projects
- **Always**: Validate results against established tools and domain expertise
